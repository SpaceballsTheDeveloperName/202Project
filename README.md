This is the 202 Project that im quite sure I screwed up on somehow.  The comments section should just open upon clicking of the folder.  Just type a name and a comment and then hit submit and your comment should appear.
The delete key does not work however and i cannot figure it out, I will try to alleviate it before the presentation.
Registration is running smoothly.
Searchbar I got the actual bar working but cannot get it to connect to my database I think my parameters are incorrect.  I will attempt to aleviate this before the presentation.

Anything that says Final Commit is used in the project, disregard the rest.
